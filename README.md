# alphabetical-posts
This WordPress plugin allows you to set a custom ordering for individual categories. Posts can be in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order. Chronological and reverse chronological (default) are also available. All this with a single drop-down option on the category editor. Works independently of themes to ensure compatibility.
